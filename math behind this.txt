Why Geometric Mean is Better Than Arithmetic Mean
Think of it like this: When predicting real estate prices, we're dealing with percentages and growth rates, not simple additions.

Example:

If prices go up 50% one year, then down 50% the next year

Arithmetic mean says: (+50% - 50%) / 2 = 0% change (no change!)

But in reality: $100 → $150 → $75 (you lost money!)

Geometric mean correctly shows this as a decline





Why it's better for real estate:

Handles Growth Patterns Better: Real estate doesn't grow by adding fixed amounts ($1000, $2000, $3000). It grows by percentages (5% this year, 8% next year). Geometric mean captures this naturally.

Less Affected by Extreme Values: If one sector suddenly has a huge transaction (maybe a commercial building sold), arithmetic mean gets thrown off badly. Geometric mean stays stable because it looks at proportional changes, not absolute numbers.

Stabilizes Predictions: By using logarithms internally, it smooths out wild swings in the data, giving more reliable forecasts.

More Conservative: Geometric mean always gives equal or lower values than arithmetic mean. This means you won't over-predict and disappoint stakeholders - you'll give realistic estimates.



The Hybrid Prediction Formula (Simple Explanation)
Imagine you're predicting tomorrow's weather. You could:

Option A: Just look at today's weather (Last Value)

Option B: Look at the pattern over the last 12 days (EWGM)

Both have problems:

Option A ignores seasonal patterns

Option B might miss sudden changes

Our solution: Use both!



The Formula:

Prediction = 34% of today's value + 34% of the 12-month pattern



Why 34% each (totaling 68%)?

Think of it like mixing two expert opinions:

Expert 1 (Last Value): "The most recent month shows what's happening RIGHT NOW"

Expert 2 (EWGM): "The last year's pattern shows the TYPICAL behavior"




We tested many combinations (30%-30%, 35%-35%, 40%-40%, 50%-50%) and found 34%-34% works best because:

Balanced: Neither expert dominates - both views matter equally

Conservative: The remaining 32% acts like a "safety buffer" - we don't fully commit to either view, which prevents wild guesses

Validated: We tested this on past data (months 60-66) and it gave the most accurate predictions

When EWGM can't be calculated (not enough history), we use 68% of the last value instead - still keeping that safety buffer.

Dead Sector Detection (Simple Explanation)
Imagine you're tracking 96 different neighborhoods. Some are booming with sales, but others might be abandoned or inactive.

The Problem:
If a neighborhood has had ZERO sales for months, should we predict sales next month? Probably not! Predicting sales where there are none wastes effort and hurts accuracy.




Our Solution:
We mark a sector as "dead" (inactive) if:

More than 20% of the last 10 months had zero sales

Example: If 3 or more of the last 10 months were zero, it's probably dead

The "tolerance" is 2 zeros allowed out of 10 (20%)

OR the sector has NEVER had any sales ever (all-time zero)

Why this helps:

Prevents false predictions: Don't predict sales in ghost towns

Improves overall accuracy: Resources focus on active sectors

Reflects reality: Some real estate markets genuinely die out (economic downturns, urban decay, etc.)

The small number (0.00000001) is just a technical detail to handle computer rounding - ignore it for understanding.

December Seasonality Multiplier (Simple Explanation)
Real estate behaves differently in December. Think about it:

December Effects:

Residential (homes): Often a SURGE because people get year-end bonuses, want tax benefits, or want to move before the new year

Commercial (offices): Often a SLOWDOWN because companies are on holiday break and not making big decisions

Our Approach:

For each sector, we look at history and ask:

"How much higher or lower are December sales compared to other months?"




The Calculation:

Calculate average December transactions

Calculate average non-December transactions

Divide: December average ÷ Non-December average

Clip the result between 0.85 and 1.40

Example:

Sector 15 (busy residential area):

December average: 60,000 transactions

Other months average: 50,000 transactions

Multiplier: 60,000 ÷ 50,000 = 1.20 (20% December boost!)

Sector 47 (commercial district):

December average: 45,000 transactions

Other months average: 50,000 transactions

Multiplier: 45,000 ÷ 50,000 = 0.90 (10% December drop)

Why Clipping (0.85 to 1.40)?

We don't trust extreme multipliers because they might be from noisy data:

Maximum 1.40: Even the busiest December shouldn't be more than 40% higher

Minimum 0.85: Even the slowest December shouldn't be less than 15% lower

This prevents one weird year from throwing off all predictions.

How It's Applied:

For December predictions only:

December Prediction = (Base Prediction) × (Sector's December Multiplier)

For all other months, no adjustment is made.

Pipeline Architecture (The Overall Flow)
Think of it like a factory assembly line:

Step 1: Raw Data Arrives

Historical transaction data comes in (67 months of sales across 96 sectors)

Step 2: Organize Into Matrix

Arrange data in a big table: rows = months, columns = sectors

Step 3: Calculate EWGM

For each sector, compute the weighted pattern over last 12 months

Recent months count more than old months

Step 4: Make Base Predictions

Combine: 34% last value + 34% EWGM pattern

Mark dead sectors as zero

Step 5: Apply December Adjustment

If the prediction is for December, multiply by sector's December factor

Other months stay unchanged

Step 6: Align With Test Set

Match predictions to the required format (ID + prediction)

Step 7: Output Final File

Generate submission.csv with 1,152 predictions (96 sectors × 12 months)
