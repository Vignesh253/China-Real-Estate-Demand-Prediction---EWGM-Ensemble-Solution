## 🧠 Methodology

### Mathematical Foundation

#### 1. Time Encoding

We convert calendar dates to a continuous time index for easier computation:

\[
\text{time} = (\text{year} - 2019) \times 12 + \text{month\_num} - 1
\]

**Example**: 2024-Aug → time = (2024-2019)×12 + 8 - 1 = 67

**Why**: Enables direct indexing and modular arithmetic for seasonality detection.

#### 2. Exponentially Weighted Geometric Mean (EWGM)

For each sector \(s\) and lag window of \(n\) months, EWGM is calculated as:

\[
\text{EWGM}_s = \exp\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot \ln(x_i + \epsilon)\right)
\]

Where:
- \(x_i\) = transaction amount at lag \(i\) (most recent = \(x_1\))
- \(w_i = \frac{\alpha^{n-i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} \alpha^{n-j}}\) = normalized exponential weight
- \(\alpha = 0.5\) = decay parameter (higher α = more weight on recent values)
- \(\epsilon = 10^{-12}\) = numerical stability constant
- \(n = 12\) months = lookback window

**Weight Distribution Example** (α=0.5, n=12):
